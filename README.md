# thyEvent

## About

thyEvent is a Flutter application developed during the course 'Independent Project for STS' by three students from Uppsala University, studying the Master's Programme in Sociotechnical Systems Engineering. The main objective of the course was to develop an application for web or mobile that lets users interact with user interfaces that fetches information from a database.

This project resulted in an event platform application, called "thyEvent". The platform facilitates a channel for arrangers of events to communicate with its attendees.
